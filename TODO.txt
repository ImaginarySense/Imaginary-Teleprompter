Next release: 2.0b
Milestone set for: Feb 29, 2016
Comment: It's important to complete the high and normal priorities for the milestone date. Work on the low priorities when yoú're done with the other ones. If something is left out, we'll include on the 2.0 or a later release.

- Keyvan -
1. CKEditor|High: Add custom "Fullscreen" button plugin to CKEditor. The button must run the toggleFullscreen function from editor.js.
2. CKEditor|Low: Move "Word Count" into the Status Bar, without sacrificing inline mode.

- Rafael -
1. Main,Editor|High: Improve fullscreen in the following ways:
	> F11 must toggle the focused window's fullscreen at any given moment.
	> You no longer need to dissable secondary prompter. Instead we need to create a smarter auto-fullscreen:
		>> In Electron, when checking for "document.getElementById("primary").value>0" or "secondary", you must also test for available screens.
			>>> If there are two screens and both instances are set to be active, do as you've already done, fullscreen primary to screen 0 and secondary to screen 1.
			>>> If there are two screens and only one instance is set to be active, if the instance is primaryPrompter, do a normal fullscreen.
			>>> If there are two screens and only one instance is set to be active, if the instance is secondaryPrompter, fullscreen to screen x (x being a variable at editor.js, set to 1).
			>>> If there's only one screen, and one instance is set to be active, do a normal fullscreen.
			>>> If there's only one screen, and both instances are set to be active, activate and do a normal fullscreen only to the secondary prompter.
		>> Note: Find an efficient way to test for these conditions.
	> Note: None of these features should interfere with browser functionality. In the browser, anything a user chooses goes.
2. Main|Low: Add "Spell Check" to Electron.
	> Languages to add: Spanish (Spain, Latinamerican), English (US and British), French, Portuguese (Brazil and Portugal's), Italian, German.
