CHANGELOG

v2.0b 16.03.23
> Improved perfect sync:

>> Implemented faster way to getCurrPos() and reduce lag.
>> Made iSync jitter less noticeable by reducing sync frequency.
> Improved status bar's styling.
> Fix: Single vFlip vertical align mismatch bug and implicit jump to anchor bug.
> Fix: Made link color inheritable for all prompted contents.
> Fix: Made prompted image and iframes use relative measures.

> Upgraded to CKEditor Full to make it easier for users to customize CKEditor.
> Improved CKEditor's panel layout, removed some features to fit most users' needs.
> Configured CKEditor's image, table, iframe, flash and math equation sizes to be relative by default in order to prevent bug that breaks synchronization.
> Added teleprompter keyboard inputs to editor so teleprompter doesn't need to be focused in order to send commands.
> Added gesture to toggle yet to be implemented touch controls.

v2.0a 16.02.25.0

v2.0a 16.02.14.0
> Moved from inline TinyMCE to inline CKEditor. Also made it easy to choose between one or the other by uncommenting and commenting imports at index.html. Notice we're sticking with CKEditor because not only is it more robust, but fixing or avoiding inline TinyMCE bugs means a lot unnecessary of work.
