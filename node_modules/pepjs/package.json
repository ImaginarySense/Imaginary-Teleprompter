  "readme": "# Pointer Events Polyfill - making pointer events usable today\n\n![PEP logo](pep-logo-shield.png)\n\nPEP polyfills pointer events in all browsers that haven't yet implemented them, providing a unified, responsive input model for all devices and input types. You can [read more about pointer events below](#why-pointer-events).\n\n## Getting Started\n\n1. Place the PEP script in the document head\n  - `<script src=\"https://code.jquery.com/pep/0.4.1/pep.js\"></script>`\n\n1. By default, no pointer events are sent from an element. This maximizes the possibility that a browser can deliver smooth scrolling and jank-free gestures. If you want to receive events, you must set the `touch-action` property of that element. Set up some elements to create events with the [`touch-action` attribute](http://www.w3.org/TR/pointerevents/#the-touch-action-css-property).\n\n1. Listen for the desired events\n  - `pointermove`: a pointer moves, similar to touchmove or mousemove.\n  - `pointerdown`: a pointer is activated, or a device button held.\n  - `pointerup`: a pointer is deactivated, or a device button released.\n  - `pointerover`: a pointer has moved onto an element.\n  - `pointerout`: a pointer is no longer on an element it once was.\n  - `pointerenter`: a pointer enters the bounding box of an element.\n  - `pointerleave`: a pointer leaves the bounding box of an element.\n  - `pointercancel`: a pointer will no longer generate events.\n\n1. As elements come and go, or have their `touch-action` attribute changed, they will send the proper set of pointer events.\n\n```html\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<head>\n  <meta charset=\"utf-8\">\n  <title>PEP (Pointer Events Polyfill)</title>\n  <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width\">\n  <!-- include PEP -->\n  <script src=\"https://code.jquery.com/pep/0.4.1/pep.js\"></script>\n</head>\n<body>\n<button id=\"b\" touch-action=\"none\">Test button!</button>\n<p><output id=\"o\"></output></p>\n<script>\ndocument.getElementById( \"b\" ).addEventListener( \"pointerdown\", function( e ) {\n  document.getElementById( \"o\" ).innerHTML = \"that was a \" +\n    e.pointerType + \" \" + e.type + \" on a \"+ e.target.nodeName;\n} );\n</script>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\nSee also the [examples in the W3C Pointer Events Specification](http://www.w3.org/TR/pointerevents/#examples) and our own [samples for using PEP](http://jquery.github.io/PEP/).\n\n### Using PEP with jQuery\n\nYou can use pointer events with jQuery and PEP:\n```html\n<div id=\"canvas\" touch-action=\"none\"></div>\n<script src=\"pep.dist.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"jquery.js\"></script>\n<script>\n$(\"#canvas\").on(\"pointermove\", function(event) {\n  draw(event);\n});\n</script>\n```\nCheck out [this jsbin demo](http://jsbin.com/bojumofowa/1/edit?html,css,js,output) for a full demo.\n\njQuery doesn't copy all properties from the original event object to the event object provided in the event handler. You can find [a list of copied and normalized properties on the jQuery API docs](http://api.jquery.com/category/events/event-object/). To access any other original properties, use `event.originalEvent`.\n\n\n## Why Pointer Events?\n\nMouse events and touch events are fundamentally different beasts in browsers today, and that makes it hard to write cross-platform apps.\n\nFor example, a simple finger paint app needs plenty of work to behave correctly with mouse and touch:\n\nCurrent platforms that implement touch events also provide mouse events for backward compatibility; however, only a subset of mouse events are fired and the semantics are changed.\n\n- Mouse events are only fired after the touch sequence ends.\n- Mouse events are not fired on elements without a `click` event handler. One must be attached by default, or directly on the element with `onclick`.\n- `click` events are not fired if the content of the page changes in a `mousemove` or `mouseover` event.\n- `click` events are fired 300ms after the touch sequence ends.\n- More information: [Apple Developer Documentation](http://developer.apple.com/library/safari/#documentation/appleapplications/reference/safariwebcontent/HandlingEvents/HandlingEvents.html).\n\nAdditionally, touch events are sent only to the element that received the `touchstart`. This is fundamentally different than mouse events, which fire on the element that is under the mouse. To make them behave similarly, touch events need to be retargeted with `document.elementFromPoint`.\n\nThese incompatibilities lead to applications having to listen to 2 sets of events, mouse on desktop and touch for mobile.\n\n**This forked interaction experience is cumbersome and hard to maintain.**\n\nInstead, there should exist a set of events that are normalized such that they behave exactly the same, no matter the source: touch, mouse, stylus, skull implant, etc. To do this right, this normalized event system needs to be available for all the web platform to use.\n\n*Thus, Pointer Events!*\n\n## Polyfill Limitations\n\n### touch-action\n\nAccording to the spec, the\n[touch-action](http://www.w3.org/TR/pointerevents/#the-touch-action-css-property) CSS property controls whether an element will perform a \"default action\" such as scrolling, or receive a continuous stream of pointer events.\n\nDue to the difficult nature of polyfilling new CSS properties, this library will use a touch-action *attribute* instead. In addition, run time changes involving the `touch-action` attribute will be monitored for maximum flexibility.\n\nTouches will not generate events unless inside of an area that has a valid `touch-action` attribute defined. This is to maintain composition scrolling optimizations where possible.\n\n### Browser Compatibility\n\nPEP should work on IE 10+ and the latest versions of Chrome, Safari, Firefox, and Opera. In any [browser implementing pointer events natively](http://caniuse.com/#feat=pointer) (detected by checking for `window.PointerEvent`), PEP won't do anything.\n\n## Building PEP\n\nIf you want to build PEP yourself from source, you'll need to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and run the following commands:\n\n```sh\n# Install all dependencies\nnpm install\n\n# Build PEP\nnpm run build\n```\n\nWhen the build completes, the generated files will be available in the `dist/` directory.\n\n*NOTE: Running the demos requires building PEP.*\n",
